# Entropy Icons
My final project submission for COSC 360. 

Entropy Icons is a Placeholder Icons and Avatars service. Entropy Icons exposes a free to use API for generating images, icons or avatars for your website.

Entropy Icons uses part of the url to seed a random number generator, which it then uses to 'randomly' generate an image from a chosen imageset. 
Images appear to be generated randomly but the same URL will always return the same image. 

Try it out at [https://icons.mvw.io/#tryit](https://icons.mvw.io#tryit)

Entropy Avatars is built using the Rocket.rs web framework which requires Nightly rust.
